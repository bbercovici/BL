 \item \textbf{Compare the classification result L* with the true location for every image patch.}
 \item  \textbf{Count the number of times L* predicts the location correctly for all test images at each location.}
 \item  \textbf{Count the number of times L* predicts the location incorrectly for all test images at each location.}
 \item  \textbf{Report results as a confusion matrix.}
